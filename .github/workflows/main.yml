      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install jimp

      # Step 4: Generate the tilemap and atlas
      # - It creates a temporary 'staging' directory to collect all images.
      # - It loops through the directories in IMAGE_DIRS and copies images to the staging area.
      # - It checks if any images were found before attempting to generate the atlas.
      # - Finally, 'free-tex-packer-cli' is run on the staging directory.

      # Step 5: Commit the generated files to the repository
      # This step will add the 'game.png'
      # It will only create a commit if the files have changed.
