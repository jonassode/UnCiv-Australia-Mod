It's a tounge in check take on Australia, but aims to be balanced and fun to play
It adds the Nation of Australia under Harold Holt, with unique features, units and buldings. 
I also hope to add some things inspired by Australia but useable by everyone like new resources, natural wonder enhacments buildings, city states and Wonders

If you like this mod give it a ‚≠ê, it really helps with giving it visibility to new players

If you find any problems or have feature requests, don't hesitate to raise an issue
