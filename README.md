# UnCiv-Australia-Mod
An Australian mod for UnCiv

It's a tounge in check take on Australia, but aims to be balanced and fun to play
It adds the Nation of Austrlia under Harold Holt, with unique features, unit and buldings. 
I also hope to add some things inspired by Australia but useable by everyone like new resources, natural wonder enhacments buildings and Wonders
