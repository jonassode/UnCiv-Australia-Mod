# UnCiv-Australia-Mod
An Australian mod for [UnCiv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv)

It's a tounge in check take on Australia, but aims to be balanced and fun to play
It adds the Nation of Austrlia under Harold Holt, with unique features, unit and buldings. 
I also hope to add some things inspired by Australia but useable by everyone like new resources, natural wonder enhacments buildings and Wonders

If you like this mod give it a ‚≠ê, it really helps with giving it visibility to new players

If you find any problems or have feature requests, don't hesitate to raise an issue
